# ZK-BLEND Development Plan (Windows)

## Overview
This document provides a detailed, phased plan for developing **ZK-BLEND**, a zero-knowledge proof system combining the strengths of zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs, and PLONK, using class groups of unknown order for transparent polynomial commitments. The system prioritizes transparency, small proof sizes, fast verification, and post-quantum security. The plan is tailored for a Windows environment, optimized for a high-performance PC (32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 8GB vRAM), but designed to use resources efficiently (e.g., <10GB disk space for the project). It assumes no prior Rust experience, providing step-by-step guidance for a beginner, including all tools, packages, and processes needed to build, test, and deploy ZK-BLEND.

## Development Environment Setup
Before starting, set up your Windows PC to ensure a smooth development workflow.

### Prerequisites
- **Hardware**: Your PC (32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 8GB vRAM) is more than sufficient. The project will use ~5-10GB disk space to avoid unnecessary bloat.
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit).
- **Tools**:
  - **Rust**: Install via `rustup` (download from `https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install`).
  - **Docker Desktop**: For containerized development (install from `https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop`).
  - **Git**: For version control (download from `https://git-scm.com/download/win`).
  - **Visual Studio Build Tools**: For Rust compilation (download from `https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/`; select "C++ build tools" and "Windows SDK").
  - **Text Editor**: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with the `rust-analyzer` extension (install from `https://code.visualstudio.com/`).
- **Verify Setup**:
  - Open PowerShell and run:
    - `rustc --version` (should show 1.75 or later).
    - `cargo --version` (Rust’s package manager, included with Rust).
    - `docker --version` (confirm Docker Desktop is running).
    - `git --version` (confirm Git is installed).
  - Ensure Docker Desktop is running (check the system tray icon).
- **Resource Usage**: Rust and Docker will use ~2GB disk space initially. The ZK-BLEND project, including dependencies and build artifacts, should stay under 10GB.

### Installation Steps
1. **Install Rust**:
   - Download and run `rustup-init.exe` from `https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install`.
   - Choose the default stable toolchain (`stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`).
   - Add Rust to PATH (default option during installation).
2. **Install Visual Studio Build Tools**:
   - Run the installer from `https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/`.
   - Select "Desktop development with C++" and ensure "Windows SDK" is included.
   - Install (~2GB disk space).
3. **Install Docker Desktop**:
   - Download from `https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop`.
   - Install and enable WSL 2 backend (prompted during setup; requires ~1GB disk space).
   - Run `docker run hello-world` in PowerShell to verify.
4. **Install Git**:
   - Download from `https://git-scm.com/download/win`.
   - Install with default settings, enabling Git Bash and PATH integration.
5. **Install VS Code**:
   - Download from `https://code.visualstudio.com/`.
   - Install the `rust-analyzer` extension (`ext install rust-lang.rust-analyzer`).
6. **Directory Setup**:
   - Create a project folder: `mkdir C:\Projects\zk-blend` in PowerShell.
   - Navigate to it: `cd C:\Projects\zk-blend`.

## Project Folder Structure
Before diving into phases, here’s the folder structure for the ZK-BLEND project, ensuring clarity and organization:

```bash
zk-blend/
├── src/                    # Source code
│   ├── main.rs            # Entry point for the binary
│   ├── lib.rs             # Library module for core functionality
│   ├── class_group.rs     # Class group arithmetic implementation
│   ├── commitment.rs      # Polynomial commitment scheme
│   ├── prover.rs          # Prover logic
│   ├── verifier.rs        # Verifier logic
│   ├── circuit.rs         # Circuit and constraint system logic
├── tests/                 # Unit and integration tests
│   ├── class_group.rs     # Tests for class group operations
│   ├── commitment.rs      # Tests for commitment scheme
│   ├── prover_verifier.rs # Tests for prover and verifier
├── benches/               # Benchmarking scripts
│   ├── benchmarks.rs      # Performance benchmarks
├── docs/                  # Documentation
│   ├── api.md             # API documentation
│   ├── setup.md           # Setup guide for contributors
├── Dockerfile             # Docker configuration for development
├── Cargo.toml             # Rust project configuration
├── README.md              # Project overview and instructions
```

- **Size Estimate**: The source code, tests, and documentation will use ~50MB initially. Build artifacts (in `target/`) may grow to ~5GB during development but can be cleaned with `cargo clean`.
- **Purpose**: This structure separates concerns (e.g., arithmetic, commitments, proofs) and supports modular development, testing, and documentation.

## Phased Development Plan

### Phase 1: Project Initialization and Dependency Setup
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks  
**Goal**: Set up the Rust project, initialize the Git repository, and configure core dependencies for Windows.

## Notes for a Rust Beginner
- **Learn Rust**: Start with [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) (free online). Focus on:
  - Ownership and borrowing (key Rust concepts).
  - Modules and crates for project organization.
  - Basic syntax (structs, enums, functions).
- **VS Code Tips**:
  - Use `rust-analyzer` for autocompletion and error checking.
  - Run `cargo check` frequently to catch errors early.
- **Windows Tips**:
  - Use PowerShell for commands (Git Bash also works).
  - If Docker issues arise, ensure WSL 2 is enabled (`wsl --install`).
  - Keep `vcpkg` updated for GMP dependencies (`vcpkg update`).
- **Community Support**: Join the Rust Discord (`https://discord.gg/rust-lang`) or ZK-BLEND forum (to be created) for help.
- **Resource Management**: Use `cargo clean` to free up disk space from build artifacts (~5GB max).
